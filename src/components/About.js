                I'm a deeply focused software engineer with a keen perception, on the lookout for the slickest solution. After years of experience in post-production and advertising, I know what it means to spare no effort for achieving goals in time. I've been working with my clients on several award-winning ad-campaigns for e.g. Erste Bank, Opel and Coca Cola and also supervising international, multilingual projects for e.g. Gardena, Parship and DM.
